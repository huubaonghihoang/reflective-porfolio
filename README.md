# 41189 Introduction to Human-centred Complex System
## Week 1
### **what have I learnt this week?**
I have learnt that 

- *a system* is a set of things working together as parts of an interconnecting network
- *complicated system* and *complext system* are different hings and the differences between those two systems

**Complicated System** | **Complex System**
-------------------- | --------------
things are interconnected dependent | the elements are independent
fixed interactions | changing its behaviors
do not adapt to the environment | they often adapt to changing environment
the ways they work are predictable (pattern) | their operations are unpredictable
e.g. a car, machine,... | e.g. living animals, nature disasters, stocks,...

- complex adaptive system is a system made up of many individual parts or agents and if there are changes to the elements or the environment, the system will react/adapt to those changes

for week 1, I also read about the standing ovation model, the collective behaviour of bees and a model of two cities. for each of these models, I looked in details the relationships between their elements, how the system's environment affect those interactions and also if those systems' behaviors are easy or hard to predict. 
 
### **what insight have I gained?**
- Upon reflection, the concept of system is very abstract in my opinion, therefore, people might have different views and opinions on this topic. 
- To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that several factors influence the complexities of systems. Our biases are one of those factors, as we all think and perceive the world differently. if we all throught the same way, we would have no need to study all these theories as there would be only one absolute conclusion  our biases have a huge impact and contribute to the complexity of a system, the complexity level and the amount of choice mechanisms will strongly impact peopleâ€™s decisions. Those decisions are unpredictable, and the results from computation can be off, as personal preferences constantly change as a person grow up. Domino effect, natural traits also affect the behaviors in systems and impact the level of their predictability levels. systems with elements that are independent and are less impacted by those mentioned effect will make their models harder to predict

### **what are the perceived strenths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, I found that adapting to learn in a 'university way' was difficult, I was good at understanding theory. However, applying the theories I have learnt into real life context was detected as one of my weaknesses. Another weakness I have detected during this learning process was that I can be easily distracted, especially when I find the content hard or boring, I tend to give up on paying attention and move to something easier.

### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**
I was struggling with using github and starting my reflective portfolio. Asking for help from the tutor and my family members assisted me to start my weekly portfolio easily. During the learning process, I aso self-taught github markdown syntax and the basis of Python's coding as preparation for the group project at the end of the semester. Starting something new is always hard, however, I did a pretty good job in researching and asking for help from my family members

### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
- Inreflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to know that system does not only exist in machines, technological systems, but it occurs in our daily life also. I did not know something simple such as a standing ovation and the nature lives were also forms of system. This theory has helped me in looking at 

## Week 2
### **what have I learnt this week?**
### **what insight have I gained?**
- I realized that a complex system in our world are normally adaptive as most systems in our world are. However, if the world followed the pool table analogy where each event is a result of the previous, then the fate of the world would be predetermined, thus they would become a complicated system

### **what are the perceived strenths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
- - My another weakness during this learning progress of this semester was not having things organized enough
### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**

- I did not realise that github was not an auto-save program and lost all of my previous content. therefore, I was advised to write my weekly reflective reports in a google docs and copy the details down after as they would be auto-saved and I will not lose any of my content even if I forget to commit those changes
