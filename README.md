# 41189 Introduction to Human-centred Complex System
## Week 1
### **what have I learnt this week?**
I have learnt that 

- *a system* is a set of things working together as parts of an interconnecting network
- *complicated system* and *complext system* are different hings and the differences between those two systems

**Complicated System** | **Complex System**
-------------------- | --------------
things are interconnected dependent | the elements are independent
fixed interactions | changing its behaviors
do not adapt to the environment | they often adapt to changing environment
the ways they work are predictable (pattern) | their operations are unpredictable
e.g. a car, machine,... | e.g. living animals, nature disasters, stocks,...

- complex adaptive system is a system made up of many individual parts or agents and if there are changes to the elements or the environment, the system will react/adapt to those changes

for week 1, I also read about the standing ovation model, the collective behaviour of bees and a model of two cities. for each of these models, I looked in details the relationships between their elements, how the system's environment affect those interactions and also if those systems' behaviors are easy or hard to predict. 
 
### **what insight have I gained?**
- Upon reflection, the concept of system is very abstract in my opinion, therefore, people might have different views and opinions on this topic. 
- To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that several factors influence the complexities of systems. Our biases are one of those factors, as we all think and perceive the world differently. if we all throught the same way, we would have no need to study all these theories as there would be only one absolute conclusion  our biases have a huge impact and contribute to the complexity of a system, the complexity level and the amount of choice mechanisms will strongly impact people’s decisions. Those decisions are unpredictable, and the results from computation can be off, as personal preferences constantly change as a person grow up. Domino effect, natural traits also affect the behaviors in systems and impact the level of their predictability levels. systems with elements that are independent and are less impacted by those mentioned effect will make their models harder to predict

### **what are the perceived strenths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, I found that adapting to learn in a 'university way' was difficult, I was good at understanding theory. However, applying the theories I have learnt into real life context was detected as one of my weaknesses. Another weakness I have detected during this learning process was that I can be easily distracted, especially when I find the content hard or boring, I tend to give up on paying attention and move to something easier.

### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**
I was struggling with using github and starting my reflective portfolio. Asking for help from the tutor and my family members assisted me to start my weekly portfolio easily. During the learning process, I aso self-taught github markdown syntax and the basis of Python's coding as preparation for the group project at the end of the semester. Starting something new is always hard, however, I did a pretty good job in researching and asking for help from my family members

### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
- Inreflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to know that system does not only exist in machines, technological systems, but it occurs in our daily life also. I did not know something simple such as a standing ovation and the nature lives were also forms of system. This theory has helped me in looking at 

## Week 2
### **what have I learnt this week?**
I was introduced to Many Model Thinking and how models are applied to explain data. Models are simplifications of the world, which help us to better organise information and come up with better decisions. Applying them can benefit us in intepreting data and allow us to make better decisions as we will see full complexities of the problems and intepret it in aa more multi-dimensional way. To be more specific, I was introduced to 3 approached when constructing a model and each approach serves different purposes. The main uses of models were also covered: reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore, which the uses have allowed me to have a deeper understanding of the models.

In week 2, two models were introduced to me, including wisdom hierarchy and diversity prediction theorem. wisdom is the ability to identify and apply knowledge integrated from the information, which lies at the top of the hierarchy. It consists of selecting and applying the correct knowledge into suitable scenarios.

Upon the reflection, I also learnt to apply many model thinking in real life context, by considering how these have been practised in school and my daily life. 
 
### **what insight have I gained?**
- I realized that a complex system in our world are normally adaptive as most systems in our world are. However, if the world followed the pool table analogy where each event is a result of the previous, then the fate of the world would be predetermined, thus they would become a complicated system
- Lack of model thinking can lead to us looking at matters in a one dimension way, and blind spots made by one dimension observation can result in limited understanding/knowledge.

### **what are the perceived strenths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
- My another weakness during this learning progress of this semester was not having things organized enough
### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**

- I did not realise that github was not an auto-save program and lost all of my previous content. therefore, I was advised to write my weekly reflective reports in a google docs and copy the details down after as they would be auto-saved and I will not lose any of my content even if I forget to commit those changes

### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
As I started learning to apply many models thinking in real life, I found that this was also practised in school. Our feelings toward certain subjects will reflect on the performance in that subjects, as having negative feelings toward a subject can lead to not having motivation and be less productive. Moreover, confirmation bias is a factor that affects our reasearch outcomes as people tend to interpret informations that they believe or want to believe in. Knowing this has allowed me to be more selective and independent in reading and researching for information. During the learning process, applying models thinking will help me maximise my potential and improve my performance academically.

## Week 3
### **what have I learnt this week?**
During the reflection of this week, I learn about:
- decision making models, signalling model, rational, models of value and power which are the core set of models, as all people models are combinations of these three models. Each will provide different predictions of how different people will behave. There are 3 aspects we can model of human
	- habits
	- values
	- spending values 

-Models of people’s value and power including:
- Last-on-the-bus (LOTB)
- Shapley.

**Decision models**
*Rational*
There is nothing intrinsic about selfishness in rational model, it depends on your measure of consumption and benefits. Rationality defines behaviours associate with optimising what you value. Rational model is criticised for the biases lie within the model, however, it is also useful as it gives us benchmarks of optimisation. 

*Behavioural*
- prospect theory demonstrates how people people feels losses keenly more than gains choose between risky and unknown alternatives
- hyperbolic discounting applies to people's tendency to want a smaller-earlier benefit over a larger-later reward when the difference comes relatively sooner in time.
- status quo bias is one type of confirmation bias in which people prefer that things remain the same or if the present situation remain unchanged
- anchoring bias a cognitive bias describing the general human instinct to focus excessively at first element of knowledge presented

*Rule-based*
Rule-based modelling is a modelling technique that employs a series of laws to specify a mathematical model in an indirect manner. There are 4 different variations. The rules can be fixed or adaptive. The choices can be decision based (sole agent) or a game (multiple agent)

**Signalling model** includes
- The girl in the foyer, cost signalling theory, discrete and continuous signal.
These signals define the signals people send under certain conditions to express the information.
### **what insight have I gained?**
Many models work in theory and in practice. That does not mean that they are always the correct approach. Sometimes we are better off constructing a single large model
### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**
Upon reflecting for this week, I find the theory very overwhelming and difficult to understand. However, as I try to apply the theories I learnt from class into real-life, I understand the concept more clearly. I also do daily revision on topics that I find difficult.
### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
Upon the reflection of this subject, these models allow people to be aware of all the available choices and therefore optimise their decisions. By adopting these models, people will be able to avoid bias and look at the problems in a more dimensional way. Applying a combination of these models allows me to identify differences between the outcomes when making decisions. Thus, as reflection, adapting the models help me making the right decision decisions and those will be made made so that they optimise the benefits 

## Week 4
### **what have I learnt this week?**
Upon the reflection for this week, I was introduced to the system dynamics models. The model is used for economic or business purposes. As the flow of money allocation and business processes happen everyday, the model demonstrates the overview of continuously changing systems and allows more understanding. 

When variables that exist within a boundary all have their own impacts on each other and have certain interrelationships, that means they are operating as a system. As everything is interconnected, investigating the potential interventions and possible functions allow a person to understand one operation more. 

During the week, I was introduced to the Causal Loop Diagram, which is a model that allows people to understand the detailed operation in a system. Through the CLD, I realised that it could easily be put into use on daily life as it demonstrates all possible interrelationships between the variables and how they impact each other. 

I was also introduced to the modes of interactions, which includes: exponential growth, goal-seeking and oscillation. Each of them convey a different purpose and the reason for the existence of the variables in a system. This allows me to understand the positive and negative impact lies within a relationship, thus, I could figure out if the variable is a strength or a weakness to different degrees for a system.

During the week, I was introduced to different types of network formations and its functions, which each convey information relevant to social trends, users perspective and how variables are connected. A network structure is made up of different parts including 
- The nodes’ degrees
- Path length between the nodes
- Nodes connection
- Nodes cluster
Upon reflection of this week, the Agent Based Modelling includes three main elements, including the ganets, the environment and rules.

### **what insight have I gained?**
During the reflection, I realise that each factor that exists within the system all has an impact on one another, both direct and indirect. However, whether the impact is negative or positive, the interrelationships in the system can be improved for better result and optimal productivity.

### **what are the perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
Upon the reflection, I realised that the small world network model was related to the topic that I was doing. therefore, I was good at applying the theory of network models into real-life applications

### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
The network theory was very useful as my team and I were in the decision making stage of our group projects. As the main topic was investigating the behavior of social media, the network structure (small worlds model) had allowed me to understand how social media users are connected and how information propagates on the social media system.

## Week 5
### **what have I learnt this week?**
Upon the completion of week 5 workshop, I have learnt about aggregation, which assists the prediction of data and to understand patterns and possible outcomes coming from a simple root. 

I also learnt about the probability distribution which real-life applications can be found everywhere. A probability distribution associates each consequence of a random variable or procedure with the likelihood of its event. A probability is a figure that varies from 0 (impossible) to 1 (the scenario is almost certain to occur), the greater the chance value, the more possible for a scenario to occur. This model also allows approximation of likelihood and forecast how the result may vary in other contexts. Relevant to the topic, there are two types of random variables including discrete random variables and continuous random variables.

I was also introduced to the bell curve and the lognormal distribution diagram, which are diagrams that visualise and convey all important factors in the probability distribution. Upon the reflection, I learnt how to read and understand both diagrams in order to understand the data analysis when it is needed. The long-tailed distributions (Power laws distribution) represent the statistical distribution which the larger the spread, the rarer. I was also introduced to the models that make up the power laws and their implications.

The linear model illustrates the correlation between factors within a system. During this week, I also learnt to interpret the data showing on those linear diagrams to understand coefficients of independent variables including 
- Sign
- Significant (p-value)
- Magnitude
### **what insight have I gained?**
Linear regression is a very useful tool in our daily life, as we can investigate the potential correlation between a factor and an impact in a system. Thus, this helps come up with optimal solutions for real-life problems.
The world is non-linear. Therefore, sometimes, only a few techniques from linear regression can be integrated into modelling solutions for non-linear problems.
### **what are the perceived strenths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
I self-learnt to plot linear diagrams on Excel and interpret it myself,which I was selk-conscious and motivated about how important these skills are in the future
### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**
It was hard at first trying to plot the diagrams that I was new to, however, I realised that extensive practice is all that needed to be good at something.
### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
As I start to learn about stock trading, the probability distribution model can help me estimate the chance that a given financial asset will fall between or within a specific range.
Probability distribution is used to examine the probability of a user to interact with a post that contains an advertisement on social media. 

## Week 6
### **what have I learnt this week?**
Upon the reflection of week 6 workshop, I learnt that our current keyboard arrangement was for less jamming of keys and it was influenced by the previous typewriters. The key arrangement is a path dependence real-life application, which the theory is centred around the outcome probabilities of the previous results. The Urn models are used to describe the path dependence, it allows the path-dependence models to be distinguished. During the week, I had learnt the mathematics used in the Urn Models and read through its applications.
During the week, I was also introduced to the concavity and convexity growth, which are the non-linear models. These models visualise the positive and negative result of systems’ data. 
- Convexity: has increasing slope which the function’s value rises as the variable’s value increases
- Concavity: has slope which decreases
When a concavity is assumed, there is a bias in diversity and risk aversion. As an application of this model, we also looked into why certain countries grow and some not. However, if the rate of growth is high, it is very hard to keep up, and countries with high growth rate might lose their momentum and stop the growth as a consequence.
Just like the small-world model that we learned in previous week, I also learned about the information propagation and how it is spread between participants. Upon the reflection, I realised that the riot model and the standing ovation we did in the first week share the same operating system and requirements. Each person has their own threshold before joining the bandwagon. The spread of information are represented in below models:
- Broadcast
- Diffusion
- Riot model
- Bass model
- Contagion model
These models not only spread information, but it can also be applied into the COVID-19 situation, with the potential infection acting like the spread of information.
### **what insight have I gained?**
Not all cases rely on threshold, there are numerous factors that affect a person’s decision whether to join the bandwagon or not. As social media has become a huge part in human’s lives, it has influenced users' perspectives and the way they react to certain things.
### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
When I have to guess the side of a coin when flipping, if the first 9 turns the side all shows tail. Then, I will automatically think that the 10th turn will be heads, as the probability of 10 tails straight is low. In fact, the probability of each side will still be 50% as there are two sides of a coin. 
Refer to the Random Walk theory and the insight I gained, I learnt to think more critically and not instinctively. 

## Week 7 
### **what have I learnt this week?**
Markov Models is used to place preventative measures for things because you know the probability of the states from changing. Markov Model estimates decisions to averse risks and potentially save costs as well but it's more about understanding behaviours rather than decision making. During the workshop, we practice calculating the examples using the Markov Model
During the week, we also look into equilibrium functions, which the Lyapunov function is used to describe a model. The Lyapunov function also suggests how fast the process will reach the equilibrium change.  
During this week, I also looked into the peer effect and the segregation model. This model allow me to learn the algorithm of a spread, which the standing ovation that we learnt in week 1 is also related to the segregation model
The human diversion and characteristics were also looked into. The topic of culture changes over time and cannot be defined exactly. Cultures differ in locations and affect the way someone reacts to certain situations. 
### **what insight have I gained?**
The changing state is temporary if the underlying transition probabilities are fixed over time, and the equilibrium will eventually remain the same. Instead of paying attention in the changing states, changing transition probabilities are more permanent.
### **what are the perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
I struggled with the class content, and did not have time to do depth study for those theories. Upon the reflection, I realised that more effort needed to be put into the learning process.
### **what were the challenges I have encountered and how well did I handle them?**
For this week, as we moved from lectures to workshops, the theories were hard to understand and catch up with. However, once we encountered the examples and figured out ways to answer it, I found the theories easier to understand. 
### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
Upon reflection this week, I find Ravindra’s example of the Markov Model very interesting and can easily be found in daily life, which the example is about the changing in number of alert and bored students in a class. 

## Week 8
### **what have I learnt this week?**
I was introduced to the Colonel Blotto Game, in which there is no ultimate answer or strategy to the game. The game can also be applied in real life, where the allocation of resources affects the outcome of a system. There are numerous factors that also affect the outcome of the systems based on the Colonel Blotto Game, which the participants do not have control over.
The prisoner's dilemma is also applied into everyday life regularly. The concept focuses on the cooperation between the participants in order to optimise or achieve an outcome. As there are several possible outcomes depends on what each participant decide to 
### **what insight have I gained?**
In order to solve collective actions and common resource problems, the context of the struggle is needed. The mathematical model alone will not be an ultimate solution, in fact, it will not be enough to answer the problem.
### **what theory proved to be useful? what have I learnt from this?**
The COlonel Blotto Game can be applied into the world and how each nation deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no ultimate cure for this pandemic, however, the restrictions that each nation applies will affect the national result of the pandemic. The better the restrictions and rules a nation has, the lower cases number they would get.
